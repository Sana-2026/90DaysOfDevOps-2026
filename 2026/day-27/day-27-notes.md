## Task 1: Audit Your Current GitHub Profile
Before making changes, assess where you stand:

### 1. Visit your own GitHub profile as if you were a stranger — what impression does it give?
### 2. Answer in your notes:
          * Is your profile picture professional?
              - Yes
          * Is your bio filled in? Does it say what you do?
              - Yes
          * Are your pinned repos relevant, or are they random forks?
              - My repos are relevant, I am working on them.
          * Do your repos have descriptions, or are they blank?
              - Repos which I created have descriptions. 
          * Would a recruiter understand what you've been working on?
              - Yes i think so

  ## Task 2: Create Your Profile README
  
1. Create a special repository with the same name as your GitHub username (e.g., github.com/yourname/yourname)
      - done already
2. Add a README.md — this will appear on your profile page
      - done already
3. Include the following in your profile README:
   
  - A short introduction — who you are, what you're learning
       - I have an intro already i will improvise it again .
  - What you're currently working on (e.g., 90 Days of DevOps)
       -  
  - Skills/tools you know or are learning (Linux, Git, Python, Shell, etc.)
    * I have updated this section again
  - Links to your important repos
    * I have pinned important repos
  - How to reach you (LinkedIn, Twitter, email — whatever you're comfortable sharing)
    * Already added these details
4. Keep it clean and simple — don't overload it with badges and widgets


## Task 3: Organize Your Repositories
Create and organize the following repos (if you don't have them already):

### 1.90 Days of DevOps — your fork or personal repo with all daily submissions
       - Done ✔
       
### 2.Shell Scripts — a dedicated repo for all your shell scripting work

      - Done ✔     
      
### 3.Python Scripts — a dedicated repo for your Python projects

 - I will be creating the repo, once i start studying python will update the repo.
      
### 4.DevOps Notes — a repo for your learning notes, cheat sheets, and references
