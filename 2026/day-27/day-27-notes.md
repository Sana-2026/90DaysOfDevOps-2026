## Task 1: Audit Your Current GitHub Profile
Before making changes, assess where you stand:

### 1. Visit your own GitHub profile as if you were a stranger — what impression does it give?
### 2. Answer in your notes:
          * Is your profile picture professional?
              - Yes
          * Is your bio filled in? Does it say what you do?
              - Yes
          * Are your pinned repos relevant, or are they random forks?
              - My repos are relevant i working on them.
          * Do your repos have descriptions, or are they blank?
              - Repos which I created have descriptions. 
          * Would a recruiter understand what you've been working on?
              - Yes i think so

  ## Task 2: Create Your Profile README
  
1. Create a special repository with the same name as your GitHub username (e.g., github.com/yourname/yourname)
      - done already
2. Add a README.md — this will appear on your profile page
      - done already
3. Include the following in your profile README:
   
  - A short introduction — who you are, what you're learning
       - I have an intro already i will improvise it again .
  - What you're currently working on (e.g., 90 Days of DevOps)
       -  
  - Skills/tools you know or are learning (Linux, Git, Python, Shell, etc.)
  - Links to your important repos
  - How to reach you (LinkedIn, Twitter, email — whatever you're comfortable sharing)

4. Keep it clean and simple — don't overload it with badges and widgets


## Task 3: Organize Your Repositories
Create and organize the following repos (if you don't have them already):

### 1.90 Days of DevOps — your fork or personal repo with all daily submissions
       - Clear README explaining what the challenge is
       - Organized folder structure by day
       
### 2.Shell Scripts — a dedicated repo for all your shell scripting work

      - Move/copy your scripts from Days 16–21 here
      - Add a README listing what each script does
      
### 3.Python Scripts — a dedicated repo for your Python projects

      - Move/copy your scripts from Days 7–15 here
      - Add a README listing what each script does
      
### 4.DevOps Notes — a repo for your learning notes, cheat sheets, and references

      - Add your shell scripting cheat sheet (Day 21)
      - Add your git-commands.md
      - Organize by topic (Linux, Git, Python, etc.)
      
For every repo, make sure you have:

* A clear, descriptive repo name (use hyphens, not spaces — e.g., shell-scripts not Shell Scripts)
* A one-line description on GitHub
* A proper README.md explaining what's inside
* A relevant .gitignore

## Task 4: Pin Your Best Repos
1. Go to your GitHub profile and select 6 pinned repositories
   
2. Choose repos that best represent your work and learning
   
3. Make sure each pinned repo has a description and README

## Task 5: Clean Up

1. Delete or archive repos that are empty, abandoned, or irrelevant

2. Rename any repos with unclear names

3. Make sure you're not exposing any secrets (.env files, API keys, passwords) in any repo — check your commit history too

## Task 6: Before & After

1. Take a screenshot of your GitHub profile before you started today

2. Take a screenshot after all your changes

3. Add both to your day-27-notes.md

4. Write 3 things you improved and why
