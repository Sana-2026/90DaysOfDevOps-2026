# Day 07 – Linux File System Hierarchy & Scenario-Based Practice

## 🔹 Core Directories 

## / (root)

### What it contains:

The top-level directory. Every file and folder in Linux starts from here.

Example (ls -l /):
You’ll see folders like bin, etc, home, var, usr

### I would use this when ?

I want to understand the overall system structure or navigate to any directory.

##/home

### What it contains ?

Home directories for normal users (documents, downloads, projects).

Example (ls -l /home):
ubuntu, ec2-user, or your username

### I would use this when ?

I’m working as a normal user and storing personal files or code.

## /root

### What it contains:

Home directory of the root (admin) user.
Example (ls -l /root):
.bashrc, .ssh, scripts

## I would use this when ?

I’m logged in as root and performing administrative tasks.

### /etc

## What it contains:

System-wide configuration files.

Example (ls -l /etc):
ssh/, nginx/, hosts, passwd

### I would use this when ?

I need to configure services like SSH, Nginx, or system settings.

## /var/log

### What it contains:

Log files generated by the system and services.

Example (ls -l /var/log):
syslog, auth.log, nginx/

### I would use this when ?

I’m troubleshooting issues or checking why a service failed. 🔥 

## /tmp

### What it contains:

Temporary files created by applications and users.

Example (ls -l /tmp):
Random temp files or folders

### I would use this when?

I need quick temporary storage (files here may be deleted after reboot).

🔹 Additional Directories

## /bin

### What it contains:

Essential command binaries required for system boot and repair.

Example (ls -l /bin):
ls, cp, mv, cat, bash

### I would use this when ?

I run basic Linux commands even in minimal or recovery mode.

## /usr/bin

### What it contains:

Most user-level command binaries and applications.

Example (ls -l /usr/bin):
git, python3, vim, docker

### I would use this when ?

I install and run standard user applications and tools.

## /opt

### What it contains:

Optional or third-party software installed manually.

Example (ls -l /opt):
google/, custom-app/

### I would use this when ?

I install custom or third-party applications outside system defaults.

### Day 07 – Scenario-Based Practice

#### Scenario 1: Service Not Starting

🚨 Runbook: myapp failed after reboot

1️⃣ Check service status

systemctl status myapp → Checks whether the service is running and shows the failure reason.


2️⃣ Check logs from current boot

journalctl -u myapp -b -n 50 → Shows the last 50 log entries for myapp from the current boot.


3️⃣ Verify service starts on reboot

systemctl is-enabled myapp → Verifies whether the service is configured to start on reboot.


4️⃣ Check config / dependencies

myapp --config-test → Validates the application configuration for errors.


5️⃣ (Optional) Try restart

systemctl restart myapp → Attempts to restart the service after checks.


#### Scenario 2: High CPU Usage

1️⃣ Quick live CPU view

top, htop → See CPU usage in real time.

2️⃣ List top CPU-consuming processes

ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10  → Shows top 10 CPU hogs.

3️⃣ Check CPU cores & load

uptime → Confirms system load vs CPU capacity.

 #### Scenario 3: File Permissions Issue

  Problem:
  A script at /home/user/backup.sh is not executing.
  Running ./backup.sh returns: Permission denied.

👉 Reason: The file does not have execute (x) permission.


✅ Step 1: Check current permissions

    ls -l /home/user/backup.sh

    -rw-r--r--  backup.sh

    🔴 No x means the script is not executable.


✅ Step 2: Add execute permission

    chmod +x /home/user/backup.sh

This allows the file to be executed as a script.

✅ Step 3: Verify permissions again

   ls -l /home/user/backup.sh
   
   -rwxr-xr-x  backup.sh
   
  🟢 x is now present — script is executable.

  ✅ Step 4: Run the script
  
    ./backup.sh

🔑 Key DevOps Takeaway

Linux won’t run a script unless it has execute permission.
