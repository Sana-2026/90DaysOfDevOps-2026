Day 07 – Linux File System Hierarchy & Scenario-Based Practice

🔹 Core Directories 
/ (root)

What it contains:
The top-level directory. Every file and folder in Linux starts from here.

Example (ls -l /):
You’ll see folders like bin, etc, home, var, usr

I would use this when ?
I want to understand the overall system structure or navigate to any directory.

/home

What it contains:
Home directories for normal users (documents, downloads, projects).

Example (ls -l /home):
ubuntu, ec2-user, or your username

I would use this when ?
I’m working as a normal user and storing personal files or code.

/root

What it contains:
Home directory of the root (admin) user.

Example (ls -l /root):
.bashrc, .ssh, scripts

I would use this when ?
I’m logged in as root and performing administrative tasks.

/etc

What it contains:
System-wide configuration files.

Example (ls -l /etc):
ssh/, nginx/, hosts, passwd

I would use this when ?
I need to configure services like SSH, Nginx, or system settings.

/var/log

What it contains:
Log files generated by the system and services.

Example (ls -l /var/log):
syslog, auth.log, nginx/

I would use this when ?
I’m troubleshooting issues or checking why a service failed. 🔥 

/tmp

What it contains:
Temporary files created by applications and users.

Example (ls -l /tmp):
Random temp files or folders

I would use this when?
I need quick temporary storage (files here may be deleted after reboot).

🔹 Additional Directories

/bin

What it contains:
Essential command binaries required for system boot and repair.

Example (ls -l /bin):
ls, cp, mv, cat, bash

I would use this when ?
I run basic Linux commands even in minimal or recovery mode.

/usr/bin

What it contains:
Most user-level command binaries and applications.

Example (ls -l /usr/bin):
git, python3, vim, docker

I would use this when ?
I install and run standard user applications and tools.

/opt

What it contains:
Optional or third-party software installed manually.

Example (ls -l /opt):
google/, custom-app/

I would use this when ?
I install custom or third-party applications outside system defaults.

Day 07 – Scenario-Based Practice

Scenario 1: Service Not Starting

🚨 Runbook: myapp failed after reboot

1️⃣ Check service status

systemctl status myapp → Checks whether the service is running and shows the failure reason.


2️⃣ Check logs from current boot

journalctl -u myapp -b -n 50 → Shows the last 50 log entries for myapp from the current boot.


3️⃣ Verify service starts on reboot

systemctl is-enabled myapp → Verifies whether the service is configured to start on reboot.


4️⃣ Check config / dependencies

myapp --config-test → Validates the application configuration for errors.


5️⃣ (Optional) Try restart

systemctl restart myapp → Attempts to restart the service after checks.
