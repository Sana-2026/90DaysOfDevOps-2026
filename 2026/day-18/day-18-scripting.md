## Challenge Tasks

## Task 1: Basic Functions

Create functions.sh with:
A function greet that takes a name as argument and prints Hello, <name>!
A function add that takes two numbers and prints their sum
Call both functions from the script

## Task 2: Functions with Return Values

Create disk_check.sh with:
A function check_disk that checks disk usage of / using df -h
A function check_memory that checks free memory using free -h
A main section that calls both and prints the results

## Task 3: Strict Mode — set -euo pipefail

Create strict_demo.sh with set -euo pipefail at the top
Try using an undefined variable — what happens with set -u?
Try a command that fails — what happens with set -e?
Try a piped command where one part fails — what happens with set -o pipefail?
Document: What does each flag do?

set -e →
set -u →
set -o pipefail →

## Task 4: Local Variables

Create local_demo.sh with:
A function that uses local keyword for variables
Show that local variables don't leak outside the function
Compare with a function that uses regular variables

## Task 5: Build a Script — System Info Reporter
Create system_info.sh that uses functions for everything:

A function to print hostname and OS info
A function to print uptime
A function to print disk usage (top 5 by size)
A function to print memory usage
A function to print top 5 CPU-consuming processes
A main function that calls all of the above with section headers
Use set -euo pipefail at the top
Output should look clean and readable.
